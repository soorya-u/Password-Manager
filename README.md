# **Password Manager**

**Description**: The password manager is a Python project that securely stores and manages user passwords. It allows users to store their passwords for various accounts, generate strong passwords, and retrieve passwords when needed.

**Scope**: The scope of this project involves implementing encryption algorithms to secure password storage, designing a user interface to input and retrieve passwords, and developing functions to generate strong passwords and store/retrieve them from a database.

**Concepts Used**: The Concepts of *Hashing* and *Encryption* has been used along with the implementation of a *Basic Database* and a *Graphical User Interface*. The Detailed Description of the Project has been given below.

## Cryptography

`cryptography` is a package which provides cryptographic recipes and primitives in Python. It is used to Encrypt and Decrypt User Passwords using a Unique Key.


## Database

`SQLite` is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. It is used to store and maintain datas recieved from the user.


## Graphical User Interface

`Tkinter` is the standard GUI library for a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. It is used to create a Simple Graphical User Interface for the Application.

## Hashing

`hashlib` implements a common interface to many different secure hash and message digest algorithms. It is used to hash the Password of our Application and use it for Verification.

## Regular Expression

`re`  provides regular expression matching operations. It is used to set Rules for Username and Password.
