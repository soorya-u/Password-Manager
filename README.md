# **Password Manager**

## About Project

**Description**: The password manager is a Python project that securely stores and manages user passwords. It allows users to store their passwords for various accounts, generate strong passwords, and retrieve passwords when needed.

**Scope**: The scope of this project involves implementing encryption algorithms to secure password storage, designing a user interface to input and retrieve passwords, and developing functions to generate strong passwords and store/retrieve them from a database.

**Concepts Used**: The Concepts of *Hashing* and *Encryption* has been used along with the implementation of a *Basic Database* and a *Graphical User Interface*. The Detailed Description of the Project has been given below.

## Modules Used

### Cryptography

[*cryptography*](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/) is a package which provides cryptographic recipes and primitives in Python. It is used to Encrypt and Decrypt User Passwords using a Unique Key.

### Database

[*sqlite3*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. It is used to store and maintain datas recieved from the user.

### Graphical User Interface

[*Tkinter*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) is the standard GUI library for a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. It is used to create a Simple Graphical User Interface for the Application.

### Hashing

[*hashlib*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html#) implements a common interface to many different secure hash and message digest algorithms. It is used to hash the Password of our Application and use it for Verification.

### Regular Expression

[*re*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) provides regular expression matching operations. It is used to set Rules for Username and Password.

### Other Modules

- [*os*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)
- [*sys*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html)
- [*PIL*](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
- [*enum*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html)
- [*random*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)
- [*wonderwords*](https://pypi.org/project/wonderwords/)
